    <PageText>
      <pText><![CDATA[These nodes are cheap and have low capabilities. They are static, energy efficient and simple. The deployment has high density in order to increase network lifetime and survivability. These nodes are resource constrained with no IP support. These nodes perform basic functionalities such as data aggregation, auto configuration and power saving. They are generally used for environment monitoring applications.]]></pText>

    <PageText>
      <pText><![CDATA[These nodes are more expensive than low-end sensor nodes. These nodes may have mobility. They have fewer constraints with respect to complexity and energy efficiency. They perform functionalities such as localization, Quality of Service (QoS) support, TCP/IP support, power control or traffic control and intelligence. These nodes are used in applications like home networks, Supply Chain Management (SCM), asset management and industrial automation.]]></pText>

    <SubHeading><![CDATA[High-end sensor nodes: ]]></SubHeading>

    <PageText>
      <pText><![CDATA[These nodes are deployed in a low density manner. They are able to handle multimedia data (video) with QoS requirements. An essential feature of these nodes is mobility. Example for these types of nodes is smart phones. These nodes are applied in military or bio/medical application.]]></pText>
