        single malfunction proof, cost effective,efficient and can be used for speeded up missions. 
        Following are the features of UAV networks..]]></pText>
    </PageText>
    <ol>
        <li>a. Infrastructure-based or ad hoc :Most of the available literature treats UAV networks as ad hoc networks. 
          Depending on the application, the UAV network could have stationary, slow moving or highly mobile nodes. 
          Many applications require UAV nodes to act as base stations in the sky to provide communication coverage to an area. 
          Thus, unlike MANET and VANET ad hoc networks, the UAV networks could behave more like infrastructure-based networks for these applications. These would have UAVs communicating with each other and also with the control center. Such a network would resemble the fixed wireless network with UAVs as base stations except that they are aerial. There is, however, a class of applications where the nodes would be highly mobile and would communicate, cooperate and establish the network dynamically in an ad hoc manner. In such a case the topology may be determined, and the nodes involved in forwarding data decided, dynamically. There are many issues that affect both UAV infrastructure based and UAV ad hoc networks. For example, replacing nodes by new nodes when they fail or their power gets exhausted. </li>
    
        <li>
          b.	Server or client: Another point of distinction is whether the node acts as a server or a client. 
          In vehicular networks they are usually clients, in mobile ad hoc networks most of the time they would be 
          clients and may also provide forwarding services to other clients’ data. In UAV networks, the UAV nodes are 
          usually servers, either routing packets for clients or relaying sensor data to control centers.
        </li>

        <li>
          c.	Star or mesh: Architecture of UAV networks for communication applications is an understudied area. 
          The simplest configuration is a single UAV connected to a ground based command and control center. 
          In a multi-UAV setting, the common topologies that can be realized are star, multi-star, mesh and 
          hierarchical mesh.
        </li>

        <li>
          d.	Large coverage area: UAV networks especially multi-UAV networks can cover a large area compared to other
           kinds of networks. This makes it cost effective.
        </li>
        <li>
          e.	Easily reconfigurable: The nodes monitor their links and any failures trigger the reconfiguration process.
           The autonomous network reconfiguration system requires computational overhead and reasonable bandwidth. 
           There are times when some of the UAVs could go out of service because of battery drain or communication 
           failure.In such cases the remaining nodes in the network re-organize and re-establish communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          f.	Flexible deployment and management using SDN: UAV networks apply the concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN) 
          for flexible deployment and management of wireless environments. In networks like VANETs, the use of SDN can help 
          in path selection and channel selection. This helps in reducing interference, 
          improved usage of wireless resources including channels and routing in multi-hop mesh networks.
        </li>

        <li>
          g.	Routing protocol should be adaptive: Static protocols have static routing tables,
           which are computed and loaded when the task starts. These tables cannot be updated during an operation. 
           Because of this constraint, these systems are not fault tolerant or suitable for dynamically changing 
           environment. UAV systems need routing protocols that are adaptive in nature.
        </li>

          <pText><![CDATA[UAVS pose a large number of challenges which are still 
            undergoing researches to mitigate the challenges.]]></pText>
        </PageText>
        
        <li>
          a.	Link failures: The UAV networks constituted for various applications may vary from slow dynamic to the 
          ones that fly at considerable speeds. The nodes may go out of service due to failure or power constraints 
          and get replaced by new ones. Link disruption may frequently occur because of the positions of UAVs and ground 
          stations. Additionally, the links could have high bit error rates due to interference or natural conditions. 
          Links are prone to malfunction due to environmental effects like winds, rain etc.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          b.	Huge power requirements: Each drone needs to be powered  by  battery  or other sources like solar energy. 
          The power requirements are high since each node continuously monitors or senses data. In green networks, 
          radios in the nodes may be automatically switched off for power conservations when the load is low.
        </li>

        <li> 
          c.	Change in network topology: There will be frequent change in network topology due to several reasons
           like malfunctioning of UAVs, changes in the relative position of UAVs and intermittent link nature.
           The fluid topology, the vanishing nodes and finicky links would all challenge the designer to go beyond
            the normal ad hoc mesh networks.
        </li>

        <li>
          d.	Lack of suitable routing algorithm: The routing protocol cannot be a simple implementation of a 
          proactive or a reactive scheme. The inter-UAV backbone has to repeatedly reorganize itself when UAVs fail.
           In some cases the network may get partitioned. The challenge would then be to route the packet from a source
            to a destination while optimizing the chosen metric. Another challenge would be to maintain users’ sessions
             by transferring them seamlessly from an out of service UAV to an active UAV. Several existing routing protocols 
             have been in the zone of consideration of researchers and quite a few variations have been proposed. While newer 
             protocols attempt to remove some shortcoming of the traditional ones, the field is still open.

          <pText><![CDATA[In addition to the requirements present in the generic wireless mesh networks, e.g., 
            finding the most efficient route, allowing the network to scale, controlling latency, ensuring reliability, 
            taking care of mobility and ensuring required Quality of Service (QoS); routing in airborne networks requires 
            location-awareness, energy-awareness, and increased robustness to intermittent links and changing topology.
             Designing the network layer for UAV networks is still one of the most challenging tasks. 
             Although conventional ad hoc routing protocols are designed for mobile nodes, they are not necessarily 
             suitable for airborne nodes because of varying requirements of dynamicity and link interruptions. 
             Routing protocols that try   to increase delivery ratio, reduce delays, scalability, loop freedom,
              energy conservation and efficient use of resources also needs to be resolved.]]></pText>

      <pText><![CDATA[Star topology can be again classified as a) single star configuration b) multi-star configuration
        In a single star configuration, each UAV is directly connected to the ground station. In a multi-star configuration, UAVs form multiple star topology. One node from each star topology group connects to the ground station. Star topology has high latency and highly dependent on ground station. Figure 5.2 (a) shows a single star configuration and Figure 5.2(b) shows a multi-star configuration.

    <PageText>
      <pText><![CDATA[Mesh topology can be again classified as (a) flat mesh configuration (b) hierarchical mesh configuration. In a flat mesh configuration, all nodes are interconnected and one node will be connected to the ground station. In hierarchical mesh configuration, there will be several mesh groups and each mesh group will be at different hierarchy. One node from the mesh group at a lowest hierarchy will be connected to the ground station. Figure 5.3 (a) shows a flat mesh configuration and Figure 5.3(b) shows a hierarchical mesh configuration. Mesh configurations are flexible, reliable and more secure compared to star configurations. Table
        5.2 shows a comparison between star network configuration and mesh network configuration.
