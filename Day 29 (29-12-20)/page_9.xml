      <pText><![CDATA[In an M2M service platform, there are several functionalities for devices, users, applications and access. The data from these devices, users, applications and access passes through an access network like ZigBee, Wi-Fi etc. and are sent to M2M area network. Similarly the data from several M2M networks passes through the access network to the core network which supports all the platforms like devices, users, applications and access. Figure 5.14 depicts an M2M service platform. We will see each component in detail.]]></pText>

      <pText><![CDATA[This platform enables access to objects or devices connected to the Internet anywhere and at any time. Registered devices create a database of objects from which managers, users and services can easily access information. This platform manages device profiles such as location of the devices, device type, address and description. M2M device platform provides authentication and authorization key management functionalities. It also monitors the status of devices and M2M area networks and controls them based on their status.]]></pText>

    <PageText>
      <pText><![CDATA[This platform manages M2M service user profiles and provides functionalities such as user registration, modification, charging and inquiry. M2M user platform interoperates with the M2M device platform and manages user access restrictions to devices, object networks or services. Service providers and device managers have administrative privileges on their devices or networks. Administrators can manage the devices through device monitoring and control.]]></pText>

    <SubHeading><![CDATA[M2M Access Platform]]></SubHeading>

    <PageText>
      <pText><![CDATA[This platform provides app or Web access environment to users. Apps and links redirect to service providers. Services are actually provided through this platform to M2M devices. This platform provides app management for smart device apps. App management manages app registration by developers and provides a mapping relationship between apps and devices. Mapping function provides an app list for appropriate devices.
        There are two types of M2M network a)non-IP based M2M network b)IP based M2M network. Figure 5.15 and Figure 5.16 shows a non-IP based M2M network and IP based M2M network respectively.

      <pText><![CDATA[In the above Figure 5.16, both M2M network and other network is IP based. Hence all the communication layers are the same for both the networks.
        M2M area network management provides various features like fault-tolerance, scalability, low cost, low complexity, energy efficient, dynamic configuration capabilities, minimized management traffic and application dependence which includes data-centric application, emergency application and real-time application.
